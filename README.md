# Fragrance Finder

Fragrance Finder is a fullstack application built using the **Express** framework with **Pug** templating and a **MongoDB** database. The application provides an interface for performing CRUD operations on two tables: **fragrance brands** and **fragrances**.

The application has minimal styling as the focus was on practicing back-end fundamentals.
